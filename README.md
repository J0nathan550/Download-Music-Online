<p>This project leverages the power of <a href="https://github.com/jerry08/SpotifyExplode">SpotifyExplode</a> for metadata extraction from playlists.</p> 

<p>Utilizing <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode">YouTube Explode</a>, it captures audio streams to download songs, particularly those initially available in .webp or .mp4 formats.</p>

<p>The magic happens with <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG.exe</a>, seamlessly converting every file to the universal .mp3 format.</p>

<p>Note: This GitHub project intentionally excludes the FFMPEG.exe file due to its hefty 116MB size, exceeding GitHub's storage limits.</p>

<p>You can easily obtain the required FFMPEG.exe by downloading it <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>After acquiring the FFMPEG.exe, place it inside the project. In the properties window, mark it as 'Content' and set the Copy Attribute to 'Copy if newer.'</p>

<p>This ensures the inclusion of FFMPEG.exe in your publish/debug directory, making your music download experience seamless and melodious! ðŸŽ¶</p>
